### Hello pretty people :3 

I'm Pavana P Karanth, a sophmore pursuing Computer Science Egineering (Major) and Psychology (Minor). 

I like cats, books and coding. 

My interests in Tech currently included Artificial Intelligence, Machiene Learning, and a bit of web development. I'm more into how we can use ML for cognitive and behavioural psychology :D

I'm actively seeking internships and research opportunities in this area. 

Best, 
Pavana.
